(Semantic HTML helps web browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, and human developers understand the components of a web page)</li>

-I sorted the <h1>-<h6> tags sequentially
-I’ve added alt attribute within the Img tags if the image can’t be displayed.

-I’ve checked that all links are functioning correctly.
-I’ve added comments before each element or section of the page.
